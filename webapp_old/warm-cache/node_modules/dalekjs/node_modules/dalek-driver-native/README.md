## Docs

Dalek's Native driver for third party driver communication. Defines a set of javascript interfaces,
every third party needs to implement in order to be Dalek compliant.
Details will follow soon. In the meantime, please check the [API Docs](http://dalekjs.com/package/dalek-driver-native/master/api/index.html).

It comes bundled with a Webdriver compliant adapter. Please check that one out, if you want to see how drivers
can be implemented.
