# Kvik
A framework for developing interactive data exploration applications in genomics
and systems biology. It is a collection of packages in the [Go programming
language](http://golang.org) that help application developers i) interface with
the R statistical programming language; ii) specify and run statistical analysis
pipelines; and iii) interface with online databases such as
[MsigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/) and
[KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). It also contains a Javascript package for
visualizing KEGG pathways using [d3](http://d3js.org). 

Kvik is in continuous development. 

## Name
The project is named after [Fridtjof
Nansen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fridtjof_Nansen) lead slead dog **Kvik**
on his Fram expedition to the North Pole 1893-1896.  

## History
The project started as a system for exploring KEGG pathway maps together with
gene expression datasets from the [Norwegian Women and Cancer
(NOWAC)](https://site.uit.no/nowac/). Over the course of the last two years 
the project has moved from being a specific application into a generic framework
for building applications that interface with data analysis in R and online
databases.
